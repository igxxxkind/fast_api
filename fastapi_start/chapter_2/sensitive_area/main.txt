# there is a list of good practices to implement in sensitive and secure areas:
# 1. Data validation and sertialization - use Pydantic to define strict objects and validate incoming data. Incoming and outgoing data should match fixed schemas.
# 2. Implement control mechanisms to ensure users can access only the allowed objects.
# 3. Secure communications and protocols like HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
# 4. Ensure Database security.
# 5. Update regularly.
# 6. Use logging for handling unusual access patterns or potential breaches.
